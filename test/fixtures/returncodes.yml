warning:

critical:
  code: 2
  name: Critical
  desc: The plugin detected that either the service was not running or it was above some "critical" threshold

  desc: Invalid command line arguments were supplied to the plugin or low-level failures internal to the plugin (such as unable to fork, or open a tcp socket) that prevent it from performing the specified operation. Higher-level errors (such as name resolution errors, socket timeouts, etc) are outside of the control of plugins and should generally NOT be reported as UNKNOWN states.
